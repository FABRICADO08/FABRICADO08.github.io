Of course. This is a significant upgrade from the previous version, requiring a real backend for authentication and data storage to be "fully functioning." A single HTML file cannot do this on its own.
To achieve this, we will use Firebase, a platform by Google that provides easy-to-use backend services, including:
Firebase Authentication: For real Google & Microsoft logins.
Firestore Database: A real-time database to store slots, bookings, and questions, so data persists for all users.
The solution will be in two files: index.html (the file you provided, with some additions) and main.js (a new file for all the application logic).
IMPORTANT: Setup Steps (You MUST do this)
This code will not work until you create your own free Firebase project.
Create a Firebase Project:
Go to the Firebase Console.
Click "Add project" and follow the on-screen instructions. It's free.
Add a Web App to Your Project:
Inside your new project, click the Web icon (</>) to add a web app.
Give it a nickname (e.g., "Mentorship App").
Firebase will give you a firebaseConfig object. Copy this object. You will need it soon.
Enable Authentication Methods:
In the Firebase console, go to the Authentication section (from the left menu).
Click the "Sign-in method" tab.
Enable Google (click it, toggle "Enable", and click "Save").
Enable Microsoft (click it, toggle "Enable", and click "Save").
Create the Firestore Database:
In the Firebase console, go to the Firestore Database section.
Click "Create database".
Start in Test mode (this allows open read/write access for now, which is fine for development).
Choose a server location closest to you.
Set Up Your Files:
Create a folder for your project.
Inside, create index.html and paste the HTML code below.
Create main.js and paste the JavaScript code below.
Crucially, in main.js, find the firebaseConfig object and paste the one you copied from your Firebase project.
